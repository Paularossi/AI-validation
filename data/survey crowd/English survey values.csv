Thank you for taking part in our research. In this study, we want to understand how people perceive and classify food-related advertisements. This survey is part of a larger project that compares human judgments with automated labeling by artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve the monitoring of online ads for public health.



Here’s what to expect: 

	First, we will ask you a few general questions about yourself, including your age, gender, education, and primary language.
	Next, you will be shown five of food-related advertisements. For each ad, you will be asked to classify its content based on specific criteria such as marketing strategies, premium offers, and food categories.
	Finally, you will answer additional questions regarding your nutrition knowledge, your daily social media use, and your overall exposure to unhealthy advertisements.



Completing this survey takes on average around 20 minutes.
 

Data Handling and your Rights: 


	We will collect only the necessary data to ensure that your responses remain confidential. Your MTurk ID is collected solely to prevent you from seeing the same ad twice. This identifier will later be replaced with a pseudonymous code.
	All survey responses and any identifying information will be securely stored and processed according to current data protection regulations. Your data will be kept confidential and used only for research purposes.
	Your participation is entirely voluntary. You can choose to stop the survey at any time without any penalty. If you decide to withdraw your consent at any point—whether before or after submitting your responses—your data will be removed from our records.



If you have any questions about this study or your rights as a participant, please contact us at paula.gitu@maastrichtuniversity.nl.
